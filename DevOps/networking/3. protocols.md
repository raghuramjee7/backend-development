# Protocols

1. Protocols -  Rules defined for internet communication
2. TCP - Transmission control protocol - This ensures data reached the client without corruption
3. UDP - User Datagram protocol -  Does not ensure 100% consistenecy.
4. HTTP - Hypertext transfer protocol - used by browsers, used in web client and servers.
5. IP address - X.X.X.X - X ranges from 0 to 255
6. Global IP address - The adress of Modem.
7. Local IP address - For the modem each device has a seperate IP, called local ip address.
8. This ip assignment is done with DHCP - Dynamic host control protocol.
9. NAT - Network access translator. For modem to identify devices.
10. PORTS - To find which application to send data to, port numbers are used.
11. IP address identifies computers, ports identify applications
12. Ports are 16 bit numbers.
13. Total port numbers possible are 2^16.
14. All HTTP stuff happens on port 80
15. Mongodb runs on 2707
16. Ports from 0 - 1023 are reserved ports for computer
17. Ports from 1024 - 49152 are reserved for applications
18. Remaning ports are for us to use

## Connections
1. Physical - Optical, Coaxial
2. Wireless - Radio channels, Bluetooth, WiFi, LTE, 5G.

## Networks
1. LAN - Local area network - small house or office, in a small area.
   1. These computers are connected by ethernet cable, WiFi
2. MAN - Metropolitan Area Network - for citiies
3. WAN - Wide Area Network - connect over countries, using optical fibre cables.
   1. SONET - Synchronous optical networking -  carries data through optical cables for faster access.
   2. Frame Relay - Way to connect LAN to WAN 
4. LANs are connected through MANs that are connected through WANs.
5. Modem converts to digial to analog and vice versa.
6. Router routes the data based on IP address.
