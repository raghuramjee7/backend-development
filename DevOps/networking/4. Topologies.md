# Topologies

1. Bus Topology - Single line, all computers pick from that line. If the line is broken, it fails. Only one person can send data at a time.
2. Ring Topology -  Connected in a ring. Each system communicates to its neighbouts. It has to go through different computers to go to destination. If one connection is broken, it fails
3. Star Topology - Central device is connected to all computers. Single point of failure.
4. Tree Topology - Combination of bus and star. Each node in bus has a star topology. More fault tolerance
5. Mesh Topology - Each computer is connected to every other computer. Its expensive. Adding new systems is hard - scalability issues.
