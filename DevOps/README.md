1. Microservices Architecture is a way of designing applications as a collection of loosely coupled services. Each service is self-contained and implements a single business capability. Each service has its own database. Each service is owned by a single team. Each service can be deployed independently of other services. Each service can be written in a different programming language. Each service can be scaled independently of other services. Each service can be deployed independently of other services. Each service can be tested independently
2. Monolith Architecture is a way of designing applications as a single unit. All the code is in a single codebase. All the code is in a single repository. All the code is built and deployed as a single artifact. All the code is deployed on a single server. All the code is deployed on a single server. All the code is tested together.
3. We use strangler pattern to migrate from monolith to microservices. We create a new service and slowly migrate the code from monolith to microservices. We can use API gateway to route the traffic to the new service. We can use a proxy to route the traffic to the new service. We can use a load balancer to route the traffic to the new service. We can use a DNS to route the traffic to the new service. We can use a service mesh to route the traffic to the new service.
