## Factory Pattern
1. Factory pattern is used to create objects of a class without exposing the creation logic to the client
2. Factory pattern is used when we have a super class with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class
3. Factory pattern is also called as Virtual Constructor
4. Factory pattern is one of the most used design patterns in Java. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.
5. We have a if-else or switch case block to create the object and return it accordingly

## Abstract Factory Pattern

2. Abstract factory pattern is used when we have multiple factories and based on input, we need to return one of the factories
