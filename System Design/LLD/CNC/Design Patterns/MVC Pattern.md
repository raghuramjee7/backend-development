# MVC Pattern

1. This is an architecture rather than a pattern.
2. Model, View, Controller Pattern
3. View: What the user sees
4. Controller: The logic behind the view
5. Model: The data that is being used by the view
6. Client -> View -> Controller -> Model -> DB
7. View and Controller are tightly coupled
