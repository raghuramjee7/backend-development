# Prototype Pattern

1. We use this to make a clone or copy of an object.
2. This pattern tells that it is not the responsibility of the client to create a copy of the object but rather the object itself should do it.
3. Each class should have a clone method that returns a copy of the object.
4. The clone method should be implemented in the base class and all the derived classes should override it.
5. The clone method should return a copy of the object.
