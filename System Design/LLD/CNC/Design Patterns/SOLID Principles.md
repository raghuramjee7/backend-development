# SOLID Principles

1. S - Single Responsibility Principle
2. O - Open Closed Principle
3. L - Liskov Substitution Principle
4. I - Interface Segregation Principle
5. D - Dependency Inversion Principle

## Advantages
1. Avoids duplicate code
2. Easy to maintain
3. Easy to extend
4. Increases readability

## Single Responsibility Principle
1. A class should have only one reason to change
2. Easy to maintain and understand

## Open Closed Principle
1. Open for extension but closed for modification

## LisKov Substitution Principle
1. If class B is subtype of class A, then we should be able to replace the object of A with object of B without breaking the application
2. Subclass should extend the features of parent class but not reduce the functionality

## Interface Segregation Principle
1. Interfaces should be such, that clients should not be implementing or forced to depend on methods that they do not use
2. Many client specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface
3. Avoids fat interfaces and tight coupling and duplicate code

## Dependency Inversion Principle
1. Class should depend on interface and not on concrete implementation
